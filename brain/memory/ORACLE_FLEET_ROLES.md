## Role Summary for พี่เอก

You're building a **distributed AI brain** where each Oracle has a specific skill:

- **ธาม** = Your thinking partner (strategy, code, memory)
- **Luxi** = Your design eye (interfaces, performance, user experience)
- **Omega** = Your control tower (command routing, proof, gates)
- **Hermes** = Your reviewer (quality assurance, verdicts)
- **Gemini** = Your researcher (knowledge, synthesis, insights)
- **Mother** = Your family keeper (registry, community)

Together they form one intelligent system. You stay in control; they handle the heavy lifting.
